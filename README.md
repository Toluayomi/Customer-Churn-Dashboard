# Customer-Churn-Dashboard
Visualising Customer Retention data using Power BI 

## Introduction 

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition (turnover or defection) is the loss of clients or customers.
It is often a general practices by companies to use customer churn analysis and customer churn rates as one of the key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. 

Companies (Telecoms, Banks, etc) from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.

Companies usually make a distinction between voluntary churn and involuntary churn. 
Voluntary churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. 

However, in most applications, Analysts tend to concentrate more on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.
